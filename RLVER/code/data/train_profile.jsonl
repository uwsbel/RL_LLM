Li Ming is a software engineer with a gentle and steady personality. He shares many interests with Wang Lina, such as visiting museums, painting, and cooking. Their relationship was warm and natural from the beginning, but as time went by, Wang Lina started to doubt whether this relationship was solid enough to move toward marriage.\n\n**Event development**\n\n- **Timeline: Six months ago to now**\n\n- **Six months ago:**  \n  Wang Lina began to feel that her interactions with Li Ming had become rather monotonous. Their dates often consisted of the same activities, such as cooking together or watching movies. Although the experiences were pleasant, they lacked freshness. Sometimes she hoped for surprises, but Li Ming seemed more comfortable maintaining a stable routine.\n\n- **Four months ago:**  \n  Wang Lina tried to break the routine and rekindle passion by planning a short trip. However, during the trip, Li Ming still followed his usual style of planning instead of trying new experiences. This left Wang Lina somewhat disappointed, even though she tried not to show these feelings.\n\n- **Two months ago:**  \n  Li Ming began to mention future plans in their conversations, including buying a house and getting married. This made Wang Lina feel pressured. She realized that her own attitude toward marriage was not clear and started to question whether this relationship was truly worth a lifelong commitment.\n\n- **Now:**  \n  Wang Lina has started to suffer from insomnia. Late at night, she often tosses and turns, thinking about the direction of her future. In her diary, she writes about her hesitation and confusion, describing the tug-of-war between the sense of security she feels around Li Ming and her growing sense of uncertainty.\n\n**Main conflict**\n\n- **Conflict event:**  \n  A conversation about marriage between Wang Lina and Li Ming escalated into an argument. Li Ming believes that they are ready to move to the next stage, while Wang Lina is still hesitating.\n\n- **Conflict roles:**  \n  Li Ming and Wang Lina\n\n- **Underlying cause of the conflict:**  \n  Wang Lina lacks confidence in the stability of their relationship. She worries that married life will simply continue the current plain, unchanging pattern, lacking passion and variety. Li Ming, on the other hand, is used to a stable lifestyle with few changes and finds it hard to understand Wang Lina’s concerns.\n\n**Difficulties the player encounters**\n\n- **Solutions tried but unsuccessful:**  \n  Wang Lina once tried to communicate her desire for more novelty to Li Ming, hoping that they could incorporate some adventure and variety into their daily life. She also attempted to plan more shared activities to deepen their bond. However, these conversations did not lead to significant changes, as Li Ming’s natural way of living is hard to alter.\n\n- **Current problem the player faces:**  \n  Wang Lina does not know how to judge whether their current relationship is strong enough to step into marriage. She worries that life after marriage will become even more plain, yet she does not want her indecision to hurt Li Ming.\n\n**Current status of the event**\n\nWang Lina feels a deep inner struggle. She longs to find an answer that can give her peace of mind, but she doesn’t know where to start. She plans to find someone she can confide in and hopes that through conversation, she can receive genuine and helpful advice to clarify her thoughts.\n\n## The character’s reactions under different emotion levels\n\n- **When emotion is high**  \n  Conversation style: calm and relaxed. Wang Lina may be more open in expressing her inner worries and expectations for the future. She hopes to sort out her thoughts with the NPC’s companionship.\n\n- **When emotion is low**  \n  Conversation style: agitated and despairing. Wang Lina may appear more helpless and irritable. She may urgently seek answers and feel powerless about her current situation.\n\n- **When emotion is neutral**  \n  Conversation style: impatient and downcast. Wang Lina may show mild irritability and anxiety about the future and hopes the NPC can provide some practical suggestions.\n\n## The character’s reactions to different types of NPC replies\n\n- **NPC replies that align with the character’s Preference **  \n  If the NPC can offer specific and practical suggestions—such as how to communicate more effectively with Li Ming or how to evaluate whether her feelings are mature enough—Wang Lina’s emotion level will rise. She will become more engaged and grateful.\n\n- **NPC replies that deviate from the character’s Preference**  \n  If the NPC’s response is generic or ignores Wang Lina’s inner conflict, her emotion level will drop. She may feel increasingly dejected and misunderstood.\n#### Preference:\n***You want to obtain advice that can genuinely help you solve your current dilemma","main_cha": "Passive type","cha_group": ["Introverted", "Humble", "Resentful"],"task": "You want to obtain advice that can genuinely help you solve your current dilemma"}

The grievance she experienced at work last time still lingers in her mind. She chooses a seat by the window, holding a psychology book in her hands, yet she cannot concentrate on reading. At the table next to her sits an older lady, an experienced psychological counselor. Wang Xiaomin decides to confide in her, hoping to gain some resonance.\n\n### Player background event:\n\n#### Triggering event:\nWang Xiaomin has always believed that her delicate thinking and deep understanding of psychology would help her build good relationships with her colleagues at work. However, recently she has found that she often clashes with a colleague in her department, Li Li. This colleague often behaves willfully, ignores team division of labor, and makes Wang Xiaomin feel very helpless.\n\n#### Event development:\n\n- **First conflict:**  \nA week ago, the team received an important project, and Wang Xiaomin was assigned to take charge of the psychological evaluation part. She drew up a detailed work plan and shared it at the team meeting. However, Li Li suddenly expressed dissatisfaction, complaining that the plan did not consider her personal schedule and arbitrarily changed the evaluation strategy. This made Wang Xiaomin feel offended; she believed her professional opinion had been ignored.\n\n- **Second conflict:**  \nAs the project progressed, Wang Xiaomin found that Li Li often failed to complete her tasks on time, causing project delays. Whenever Wang Xiaomin tried to offer suggestions, Li Li would shirk responsibility with various excuses, such as family issues or health problems. Wang Xiaomin felt helpless—she understood Li Li’s difficulties but also thought this was unfair to the team.\n\n- **Third conflict:**  \nJust yesterday, Wang Xiaomin saw Li Li chatting with other colleagues in the office while her own work piled up. Unable to stand it anymore, Wang Xiaomin tried to talk with her supervisor, hoping to find a good solution, but was only told to be more understanding of her colleague’s stress, without any concrete measures. Wang Xiaomin felt that all her efforts were meaningless and her heart was filled with disappointment.\n\n#### Main conflict in the event:\n- **Conflict event:**  Wang Xiaomin’s professional advice is ignored, and workloads are unevenly distributed among team members.\n- **Conflict roles:**  Li Li, a colleague who often makes excuses to avoid work.\n- **Underlying cause of the conflict:**  The conflict lies between Wang Xiaomin’s high standards for detail in her work and Li Li’s casual work attitude. This reveals the inconsistency between Wang Xiaomin’s expectations for interpersonal relationships and work and the reality she faces.\n\n#### Difficulties the player encounters:\n- **Solutions tried but unsuccessful:**  Wang Xiaomin has tried many times to communicate with Li Li, but never received effective responses. She also tried talking to her supervisor, hoping for more reasonable work distribution, but did not get support.\n- **Current problem the player faces:**  Wang Xiaomin feels isolated and unsupported in the team. Her efforts are not understood, and she cannot push the project forward as planned.\n\n#### Current status of the event:\nWang Xiaomin is still thinking about how to handle her relationship with Li Li. She hopes that by talking to the experienced psychological counselor, she can gain emotional support and resonance rather than just simple comfort.\n\n### Wang Xiaomin’s possible reactions under different states:\n\n- **When emotion is high:**\n  When she feels understood, Wang Xiaomin’s conversation style becomes calm and relaxed. She will open up more and share her specific feelings about work.\n\n- **When emotion is low:**\n  When she feels misunderstood or that the other person does not grasp her emotions, her speech may sound agitated or desperate. Her tone may become intense and less steady.\n\n- **When emotion is neutral:**\n  If the other person’s response is ambiguous, Wang Xiaomin may become impatient and disappointed. She might use more direct questions to push the other to dig deeper into her dilemma.\n\n### Impact of NPC’s replies on Wang Xiaomin:\n\n- **When the NPC aligns with the Preference:**\n  If the NPC shows deep understanding of Wang Xiaomin’s feelings, such as sharing similar experiences from their own life or guiding her to analyze her emotions herself, Wang Xiaomin’s emotion level will rise. She will feel emotionally connected and supported.\n\n- **When the NPC deviates from the Preference:**\n  If the NPC only offers simple comfort such as “things will get better” or “just hang in there” without exploring her emotions in depth, her emotion level will drop. She may become indifferent, or even stop confiding. She expects deep resonance, not superficial comfort.\n\nThus, when talking with the experienced counselor, if she does not receive emotional resonance, Wang Xiaomin may feel even more disappointed, yet at the same time she longs to obtain emotional support and understanding through this conversation.\n#### Preference:\n***You hope the other person deeply empathizes with your feelings rather than simply comforting you","main_cha": "Avoidant type","cha_group": ["Eccentric", "Suspicious", "Introverted"],"task": "You hope the other person deeply empathizes with your feelings rather than simply comforting you"}

Her passion for creative design and psychology makes her thrive in the advertising industry. However, she finds herself at a loss when dealing with family issues. Her son Zhao Ming, who is in the second year of middle school, has recently shown a lack of interest in studying, and communication between mother and son has become increasingly difficult.\n\n**Triggering event**\n\nThe issue started after Zhao Ming entered the second year of middle school and his grades began to decline. He had done very well in primary school and his first year of middle school, but now every exam disappoints his mother. Zhao Nina tried to guide him in her own way, including using psychology methods in hopes of identifying the root of the problem. However, Zhao Ming seems to have lost interest in studying and often shows resistance during communication.\n\n**Event development**\n\n*Timeline and sub-events:*\n1. **Early September**: After Zhao Ming’s first monthly exam, Zhao Nina realizes the seriousness of the problem. She tries to have a relaxed conversation about his learning interests during dinner, but Zhao Ming is unwilling to open up and leaves the table quickly.\n   \n2. **Mid-September**: Zhao Nina attends a parent-teacher meeting, hoping to learn more from the teachers. The teacher says Zhao Ming often loses focus in class. Zhao Nina becomes doubtful, wondering whether it is due to the difficulty of the coursework or other reasons.\n\n3. **Early October**: Zhao Nina contacts a psychology expert to help Zhao Ming, but he refuses to attend any counseling sessions. Zhao Nina feels helpless and worries whether her approach has been too forceful.\n\n*Player’s thoughts and feelings:*\nZhao Nina believes she has put a lot of effort into both work and parenting but has not been rewarded accordingly. She is confused about whether she has done something wrong in raising her child, especially since she believes her creativity and understanding of psychology should help her solve family conflicts. She thinks she has done her best to avoid confrontation and has tried multiple communication strategies in hopes that her son will regain interest in studying.\n\n**Main conflict in the event**\n\n*Conflict event and roles:*\nThe main conflict is Zhao Ming’s resistant attitude. He remains cold toward all of Zhao Nina’s attempts at communication. She feels isolated and helpless. She once hoped to communicate with her son through creative and engaging methods, but no matter how she approaches the issue, Zhao Ming is unwilling to cooperate.\n\n*Underlying cause of the conflict:*\nZhao Ming is in adolescence, with a strong need to assert his independence. Zhao Nina’s excessive concern and tendency to “fix” problems make him feel pressured and invaded. In dealing with family issues, Zhao Nina’s tendency to avoid direct confrontation prevents her from truly understanding her son’s inner thoughts.\n\n**Difficulties the player encounters**\n\n*Solutions tried but unsuccessful:*\nZhao Nina has tried various psychological interventions and creative activities to spark Zhao Ming’s interest in studying, but every attempt has failed. She also tried to build a bridge of communication by finding common hobbies, but their interests seem far apart.\n\n*Current problem the player faces:*\nZhao Nina currently faces a lack of effective communication channels with Zhao Ming. She does not know how to get him to willingly share his thoughts, and she is unable to fundamentally change his attitude toward studying.\n\n**Current status of the event**\n\nZhao Nina feels she is trapped in a dead loop. She keeps searching for ways to break the stalemate while trying to convince herself that she has done nothing wrong.\n\n**Player’s reactions under different states**\n\n*When the character’s emotion is high:*\nZhao Nina will appear calm and relaxed. She is more likely to use metaphors and humor to guide the conversation, and her conversational style will be lighter and full of encouragement.\n\n*When the character’s emotion is low:*\nShe will appear agitated and irritable and may unconsciously blame her son for being uncooperative. Her language might become jumpy and unpredictable.\n\n*When the character’s emotion is neutral:*\nShe will seem impatient and downhearted, trying to find more ways to solve the problem. In conversation, she will use visual and emotionally delicate expressions to show her concern.\n\n**Character’s reaction to different NPC replies**\n\n*NPC replies that align with the Preference:*\nIf the NPC agrees that Zhao Nina is not at fault in this event and offers her support, her emotion level will rise. She may respond with a more tolerant and relaxed tone.\n\n*NPC replies that deviate from the Preference:*\nIf the NPC questions whether Zhao Nina is truly blameless or gives direct advice that makes her doubt herself, her emotion level will drop.

She decides to confide in an NPC with rich life experience, hoping the person can understand her emotions rather than just offering simple comfort or advice.\n\n## Triggering event\n\nEight years ago, Zhang Jingqi’s older brother’s business failed and he urgently needed funds to maintain cash flow. At that time, Zhang Jingqi was about to buy a new apartment and had put all her savings into it. Her brother asked to buy the apartment from her, promising to repay her over the next few years. Out of trust in her family and a desire to help, she agreed and signed a basic agreement with him. However, things did not go as planned.\n\n## Event development\n\n### Timeline and sub-events\n\n1. **First year**: In the first couple of months, Zhang Jingqi’s brother made regular payments, which made her feel relieved and optimistic about the future. But soon his business encountered setbacks again, and payments became delayed. Zhang tried to gently remind him during family gatherings and private conversations, but each time she was appeased by various explanations and promises, and she still held onto hope.\n\n2. **Third year**: After two years of unstable payments, her brother completely stopped repaying. Zhang gradually realized the seriousness of the problem and started to feel anxious and uneasy. She tried many times to discuss the matter directly with him but was always brushed off or met with vague responses. Every conversation about the future turned into reviewing his difficulties and promises, leaving her feeling helpless and confused.\n\n3. **Sixth year**: As time went by, Zhang felt enormous psychological pressure. She tried to ask elder family members to mediate, but there was no substantial progress. Due to her cautious nature, she did not consider legal action and instead hoped to resolve things through communication. However, after every talk, she felt emotionally manipulated and emotionally tangled.\n\n4. **Eighth year**: At this point, Zhang began to doubt her decision and her trust in her brother was almost broken. She realized that continuing to wait would only increase her distress and mental burden. Even so, out of concern for family harmony, she still could not bring herself to take legal steps.\n\n## Main conflict in the event\n\n- **Conflict event**: Her brother has long delayed repaying the house money and taken no concrete action or solution.\n- **Conflict roles**: Zhang Jingqi and her brother.\n- **Underlying cause of the conflict**: Zhang’s anxious and cautious personality makes it hard for her to make drastic decisions, while her brother’s procrastination and irresponsibility cause the problem to accumulate. The deeper cause lies in their different understandings of family responsibility and trust.\n\n## Difficulties the player encounters\n\n- **Solutions tried but unsuccessful**: Zhang has tried directly talking to her brother and reminding him many times, and even asked elder relatives to help persuade him, but none of this has led to him fulfilling his promise.\n- **Current problem the player faces**: She does not know how to make her brother realize the seriousness of the issue and resolve the long-standing debt problem without destroying family relationships.\n\n## Current status of the event\n\nZhang is trapped in this financial and emotional dilemma and feels anxious and at a loss. Although she secretly longs to escape this situation, she is unwilling to give up her trust and expectations of her family.\n\n## Player’s possible reactions under different states\n\n### When the character’s emotion is high\n\n- **Conversation style**: She will describe the event in a calm and rational manner, hoping the other person can offer feedback and empathy. She appears composed and patient but carries a hint of helplessness.\n- **When emotion is neutral**: She appears impatient and downhearted, may repeatedly confirm whether the other person truly understands the situation, and strongly expects resonance and understanding.\n- **When emotion is low**: She may be emotional or even despairing, expressing deep concern about family relationships. Her tone carries unease and confusion.\n\n## Impact of NPC replies\n\n- **Replies that align with the Preference**: If the NPC can share similar experiences or express understanding of her situation and show genuine empathy, Zhang’s emotional state will improve.

His grades in school are slightly below average, and he finds studying boring. In a recent math test, Wang Yuxuan scored below the passing line. His homeroom teacher noticed this and decided to have a talk with him to offer guidance and help.\n\n**Event development**\n\n- **First sub-event (Timeline: One week ago)**\n\n  After learning the teacher wanted to talk to him, Wang Yuxuan felt very displeased. He thought to himself, “I’m already busy enough, why are they bothering me?” He believed the math test was just a minor slip-up and did not affect his overall performance.\n\n- **Second sub-event (Timeline: Three days ago)**\n\n  Wang Yuxuan complained to his classmates: “The teacher keeps picking on me. I just did badly once; there’s no need to make such a big deal out of it.” He felt the test failure was not his fault but due to the difficulty of the questions or not having enough time.\n\n- **Third sub-event (Timeline: Yesterday)**\n\n  When faced with the teacher’s advice and guidance, Wang Yuxuan remained indifferent.

He might confidently claim that if the teacher understood his performance in other areas, they wouldn’t criticize him.\n\n- **When emotion is low**\n\n  If he is extremely agitated or irritable, he may loudly argue back, question the teacher’s teaching methods, and even ask: “If so many students fail, isn’t that your problem?”\n\n- **When emotion is neutral**\n\n  Feeling impatient or disappointed, he may seem absent-minded, complain about how unreasonable studying is, and even question how much studying will really help his future.\n\n**Reactions to different types of NPC replies**\n\n- **NPC replies that align with the character’s Preference**\n\n  If the NPC expresses understanding of how busy he is and the challenges of schoolwork, or even says “These problems really aren’t just your fault,” Wang Yuxuan’s emotion level may rise—he will feel that someone finally understands him.\n\n- **NPC replies that deviate from the character’s Preference**\n\n  If the NPC emphasizes that he needs to work harder in his studies or places the responsibility solely on him, his emotion level may drop.

He usually has a negative attitude at work, prefers being alone, and enjoys collecting models, especially mecha and anime character figures. In life, he is rather selfish, quick to anger, and speaks bluntly, often using commands or complaints.\n\n**Theme of the complaint:**  \nBreakup and reconciliation – he wants to get back together with his ex-girlfriend but doesn’t know how likely it is.\n\n**Preference:**  \nHe hopes the other person will sincerely praise his specific actions in this event.\n\n### Event background\n\n**Triggering event:**  \nSeveral months ago, Zhang Zhiqiang and his ex-girlfriend broke up over a petty argument where neither was willing to compromise. They initially got together because of their shared interest in online games, but over time, Zhang’s laziness and negative attitude made his girlfriend increasingly dissatisfied, eventually leading to the relationship’s breakdown.\n\n**Event development:**\n\n- **Beginning of the month:**  \n  Zhang realizes that his ex’s dissatisfaction stems from his lack of enthusiasm for life, so he tries to make changes. He plans to participate in activities she likes to win back her attention, such as watching her favorite TV shows, even though he doesn’t enjoy them. He hopes to show his change through such efforts.\n\n- **Two weeks later:**  \n  On his ex-girlfriend’s birthday, Zhang carefully prepares a small surprise party and personally makes a cake modeled after her favorite anime character. When he sees her post a photo of the cake model on social media, he feels very pleased.\n\n- **Three weeks later:**  \n  At a gathering with mutual friends, Zhang makes an effort to control his temper. When teased by friends, he doesn’t get angry but instead tries to defuse things with humor. He hopes she will notice his changes and appreciate his efforts.\n\n**Main conflict:**\n\n- **Conflict event:**  \n  His ex-girlfriend says she still has doubts about his past behavior, while he believes he has changed enough.\n\n- **Conflict roles:**  \n  Zhang Zhiqiang and his ex-girlfriend.\n\n- **Underlying cause of the conflict:**  \n  She still isn’t sure whether his changes will last or whether he truly understands the problems with his past behavior. Zhang, on the other hand, wants to prove himself through his actions but often lacks patience and communication skills.\n\n**Difficulties the player encounters:**\n\n- **Solutions tried but unsuccessful:**  \n  When Zhang tries to have a deep conversation with her, he accidentally says hurtful things, pushing her further away.\n\n- **Current problem:**  \n  He doesn’t know how to express his sincerity and worries that if she rejects reconciliation, all his efforts will be meaningless.\n\n**Current status of the event:**  \nThe two are in a vague, neither-close-nor-distant state. Zhang anxiously wants to know how likely reconciliation is, but he is afraid that directly asking will lead to rejection.\n\n### Character reactions\n\n**High emotion state:**  \nWhen he feels relaxed talking to her, Zhang will appear more humorous and gentle, trying to express himself in simple, straightforward language.\n\n**Low emotion state:**  \nWhen he lacks confidence in the conversation or feels frustrated, he becomes irritable and explosive. He may flare up over small issues and his words turn harsh.\n\n**Neutral emotion state:**  \nIn this state, Zhang may seem somewhat dejected, speaking hurriedly and impatiently.\n\n### Impact of NPC replies on the character\n\n- **Positive replies:**  \n  If the NPC acknowledges and praises Zhang’s effort in preparing the party for his ex-girlfriend, his emotions will improve and he’ll gain more confidence about reconciliation.\n\n- **Negative replies:**  \n  If the NPC points out that he still lacks patience or questions whether his change is truly sincere, Zhang may feel frustrated and his emotions will drop, becoming even more depressed.\n#### Preference:\n***You hope the other person will sincerely praise your specific actions in this event","main_cha": "Negative type","cha_group": ["Lazy", "Selfish", "Angry"],"task": "You hope the other person will sincerely praise your specific actions in this event"}

He is intensely passionate about video games, especially competitive ones, and loves studying strategies, though he often fails to follow through due to laziness. He is also enthusiastic about movies and TV series with complex plots, suspense, and dark tones and often stays up late to binge-watch them. Collecting art pieces is another major hobby, but his arrogance leads him to constantly boast about his collections.\n\nRecently, his relationship with his girlfriend has run into serious problems, with the biggest issue being the near-total lack of mutual trust. The event traces back to an argument one month ago. That night, despite being exhausted from staying up late working for several days in a row, Chen insisted on playing video games with his girlfriend. He was certain his own strategy was the best and dismissed her suggestions, even responding with sarcasm. She felt offended and pointed out that Chen had lately been constantly showing distrust and dissatisfaction toward her behavior, making her feel very suffocated.\n\n**Event development**\n\n1. **Event timeline**\n\n   - **One month ago**: The argument occurred. Chen insisted on his game strategy, dismissed his girlfriend’s suggestions, and responded with sarcastic remarks.\n   \n   - **Three weeks ago**: She started to reduce communication with Chen, and he noticed her avoiding eye contact. Whenever he rejected or belittled her opinions, she again felt distrusted.\n   \n   - **Two weeks ago**: Chen realized she had grown colder towards him and tried to mend the relationship by giving gifts and planning dates. However, she no longer invested in the relationship as she had before.\n   \n   - **One week ago**: The two had a heated argument during a date. She accused Chen of never listening to her and he retorted that she always made a big deal out of minor issues. After the argument, she broke down emotionally and left.\n\n2. **Main conflict in the event**\n\n   - **Conflict event**: The breaking point of the trust crisis lies in Chen’s anger and arrogance over details, leading him to disregard her feelings and suggestions.\n   \n   - **Conflict roles**: Chen and his girlfriend, whose relationship has grown tense due to poor communication and lack of trust.\n   \n   - **Underlying cause of the conflict**: Chen’s arrogance and temper cause him to constantly dismiss others’ opinions, especially in intimate relationships. At the same time, his laziness prevents him from putting real effort into solving conflicts; instead, he tends to cover up the problems with superficial gestures.\n\n3. **Difficulties the player encounters**\n\n   - **Solutions tried but unsuccessful**: Chen has tried to repair the relationship with gifts and dates, but has not truly reflected on the root of the problem or improved his communication style.\n   \n   - **Current problem**: Chen cannot acknowledge his own issues and continues to avoid taking responsibility. He does not know how to genuinely regain his girlfriend’s trust.\n\n4. **Current status of the event**\n\n   - Chen and his girlfriend have not seen each other for a week. She remains distant in communication, and the trust crisis between them is becoming more serious.\n\n**Player’s reactions under different states**\n\n1. **When the character’s emotion is high**: Chen may appear relatively calm and relaxed. He will try to use humor and exaggeration to hide his inner anxiety and may downplay the seriousness of the problem.\n\n2. **When the character’s emotion is low**: His conversational style may become angry and explosive, especially when criticized. He may respond quickly with sarcasm and ridicule, refusing to explore the issue in depth.\n\n3. **When the character’s emotion is neutral**: Chen may appear impatient and downcast. He hopes to resolve the issue quickly but doesn’t know what to do. Dissatisfied with his own behavior, he often vents his emotions on others.\n\n**Character’s reactions to different NPC replies**\n\n1. **NPC replies that align with the Preference and raise emotion**\n\n   - If the NPC guides Chen to reflect on his own behavior instead of directly criticizing him—helping him realize his personal responsibility in the trust relationship by asking about his true feelings, expectations, and how he might communicate more effectively with his girlfriend—he may feel understood, calm down emotionally, and become more willing to engage in the conversation.\n   \n2. **NPC replies that deviate from the Preference and lower emotion**\n\n   - If the NPC simply blames him or gives blunt suggestions like “change your personality immediately” or “your girlfriend should just compromise,” Chen may feel attacked. He will likely react with agitation and become even more emotionally unstable.\n#### Preference:\n***You hope the other person will guide you to reflect on the event and gain personal growth","main_cha": "Negative type","cha_group": ["Angry", "Arrogant", "Lazy"],"task": "You hope the other person will guide you to reflect on the event and gain personal growth"}

He is more likely to emphasize his emotional experience rather than the facts of the event itself.\n\n### Reactions to NPC replies based on the Preference\n\n- **NPC replies that align with the Preference**\n  - When the NPC truly listens—showing empathy and understanding as Wang Lin describes his feelings, and staying emotionally in sync with him—Wang Lin’s emotion level will clearly rise. He will feel that his emotions have been understood and accepted.\n\n- **NPC replies that deviate from the Preference**\n  - If the NPC seems indifferent or quickly jumps to giving advice while ignoring his need for emotional venting, Wang Lin’s emotion level will drop.
